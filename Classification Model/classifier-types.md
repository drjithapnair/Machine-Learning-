# Types of Machine Learning Classifiers

## 1. Detailed Overview of Classifiers

### Logistic Regression
- **Description**: A linear classifier that estimates probability of class membership
- **How it works**: Uses sigmoid function to transform linear combination of features into probabilities
- **Math**: P(y=1|X) = 1 / (1 + e^(-wX))
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  
  # Credit Card Fraud Detection
  model = LogisticRegression()
  features = ['transaction_amount', 'time_of_day', 'location_score']
  X = transaction_data[features]
  y = transaction_data['is_fraudulent']
  
  model.fit(X, y)
  fraud_probability = model.predict_proba(new_transaction)
  ```

### Decision Trees
- **Description**: Tree-like model of decisions based on feature values
- **How it works**: Recursively splits data based on feature thresholds
- **Math**: Uses metrics like Gini impurity or Information Gain
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
  
  # Loan Approval System
  model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
  features = ['income', 'credit_score', 'debt_ratio']
  X = loan_data[features]
  y = loan_data['approved']
  
  model.fit(X, y)
  ```

### Random Forest
- **Description**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **How it works**: Builds multiple trees using random subsets of data and features
- **Math**: Final prediction is majority vote of individual trees
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  
  # Disease Diagnosis
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
  features = ['symptom_1', 'symptom_2', 'blood_test', 'age']
  X = patient_data[features]
  y = patient_data['diagnosis']
  
  model.fit(X, y)
  ```

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Description**: Finds optimal hyperplane to separate classes
- **How it works**: Maximizes margin between classes, can use kernel trick for non-linear separation
- **Math**: Minimizes ||w||² subject to y(wx + b) ≥ 1
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.svm import SVC
  
  # Image Classification
  model = SVC(kernel='rbf')
  features = image_to_features(images)  # Convert images to feature vectors
  y = image_labels
  
  model.fit(features, y)
  ```

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**: Classification based on k closest training examples
- **How it works**: Assigns class based on majority vote of nearest neighbors
- **Math**: Usually uses Euclidean distance: √Σ(x₁-x₂)²
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
  
  # Music Genre Classification
  model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
  features = ['tempo', 'frequency', 'amplitude']
  X = song_data[features]
  y = song_data['genre']
  
  model.fit(X, y)
  ```

### Naive Bayes
- **Description**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- **How it works**: Assumes feature independence
- **Math**: P(y|X) ∝ P(y)∏P(xᵢ|y)
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
  
  # Email Spam Classification
  model = GaussianNB()
  features = text_to_features(emails)  # Convert text to numerical features
  y = email_labels
  
  model.fit(features, y)
  ```

### Neural Networks
- **Description**: Deep learning model inspired by biological neurons
- **How it works**: Multiple layers of interconnected nodes with non-linear activation
- **Math**: Output = activation(weights * inputs + bias)
- **Practical Example**:
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
  
  # Handwriting Recognition
  model = Sequential([
      Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

   }
   
   grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5)
